# Cloning, updating, pushing and pulling
The first step of installing the application is cloning the repository from
github. If you want to develop new features and add them to the master-dev
repository, you should firstly fork the project and push changes to your
own fork. When you have tested your changes and want to share them back to
the main repository you can submit a pull-request to dev-master. The
repository maintainer checks your code and if correct merge them. Its much
easier for the maintainer if you create own fork and commit your changes there
until you are done building/solving the thing your wanted to add, and then
create 1 pull request to merge all the commits you did so it can be reviewed
in one go.
